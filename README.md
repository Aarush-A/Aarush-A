I am a computer science engineering and data science student from India looking for opportunities as a data scientist and machine learning r&d. I am fairly proficient in Python, C, and C++, and currently learning more computational languages to broaden my horizon. I am working on two startups, one awarded by CSIR, Govt of India at the ideation stage. I also am looking for incubation opportunities for the same. I am currently exploring machine learning model deployment on pre-existing data structures. Do connect on my LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/aarush-agarwal-243674196/
